    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
        A <strong>casserole</strong> (French: diminutive of casse, from Provençal cassa 'pan') is a kind of large, deep pan or bowl used for cooking a variety of dishes in the oven; it is also a category of foods cooked in such a vessel. To distinguish the two uses, the pan can be called a "casserole dish" or "casserole pan", whereas the food is simply "a casserole". The same pan is often used both for cooking and for serving.
